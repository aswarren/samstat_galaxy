samstat_galaxy
==============

Fixed a few classification bugs for unaligned reads and an integer limit error. Also created a galaxy wrapper. Original work by Timo Lassmann http://samstat.sourceforge.net/ 
For galaxy, 'sanitize_all_html = False' in universe_wsgi.ini in order to correctly render results.
